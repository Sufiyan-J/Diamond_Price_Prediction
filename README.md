Title: Diamond price predictor (Machine Learning)
1.	Problem state: Diamond is one of the strongest and the most valuable substances produced naturally as a form of carbon. However, unlike gold and silver, determining the price of a diamond is very complex because many features are to be considered for determining its price. Given dataset about diamonds is processed, cleaned, analyzed and evaluated to predict the price of a diamond whose details are entered by the user. This project aims to come up with the most accurate price prediction of diamonds.

2.	Methodology and Algorithms:	The algorithm such as Linear regression is used to train the particular machine learning models on the diamond dataset for the prediction of diamond prices based on various attributes.

3.	Major Findings: The comparative analysis of various Machine Learning Regression models is done for the price prediction of any diamond. From the performance parameter values and analysis, it was found that the Linear Regression algorithm proved to be the most optimal algorithm having an R2 score of 0.9872 and formidable training and testing accuracies of 98.74% and 98.72% respectively. Hence, the Linear Regression algorithm has been implemented for the price prediction of a diamond specimen with the help of the values of attributes extracted from an image of a diamond certificate by the user.

4.	Applications: The price of a diamond can be predicted on the basis of its features and attribute values provided by the user. This helps the user or consumer to accurately determine the price of diamond without being biased or influenced by the market.

5.	Limitations: The prediction is limited to the price of a diamond as linear regression produces only a single output. If any value of an attribute is non-integer or blank there might be an error in predicting the exact price of the diamond.
